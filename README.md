## Templates

### Template | Should You Use It? | Why

- react-client | perfect match for a dynamic SPA like Netflix-GPT | Fully browser-based React app. Great for user interactions, API integration, routing, etc.

- react-server | Not needed unless you're doing Server-Side Rendering (SSR) | Overkill for SPA unless you're optimizing SEO or page speed on first load

- react-static | Not ideal for dynamic UIs or APIs | Best for static blogs or landing pages â€” not suited for dynamic React apps like GPT/chat/video UIs

- vanilla | Only if you're doing everything from scratch (no React) | Not recommended here since you're using React and need SPA capabilities
